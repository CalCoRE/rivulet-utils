    "Using data that connects directly to students' lives can turn a math or science lesson into a real investigation. This repository provides tools to fetch data from various APIs, providing you with datasets that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relatable:** Using recent, local data allows students to explore their own neighborhoods or recent events, helping them build a relationship with the information.\n",
    "* **Real:** Using real-world data that weren't created just to model a specific learning goal inspires students to ask rich statistical questions rather than just solving a textbook problem.\n",
    "* **Revealing:** Good data doesn't just show numbers; it shows \"signature patterns\" that illustrate key scientific ideas, helping students see how systems actually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, our collection of notebooks includes tools to fetch data from the following APIs:\n",
    "* The U. S. EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API\n",
    "* The NOAA CoastWatch and Oceanwatch Systems\n",
    "* The USGS Water Quality eXchange (WQX) System\n",

    "### What makes finding good data so hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there is data everywhere online, finding the *right* dataset for a lesson is surprisingly difficult. Curated lists of datasets exist, but they are often stuck in time and can't update themselves to fit your current curriculum needs or recent events. Finding data from public portals that is clear enough for students to analyze, where the resolution is right and patterns aren't too messy, is a major challenge. And when you grab data from the web, it’s often hard to tell if it’s accurate, valid, or robust enough for a classroom lesson."

    "\n",
    "These notebooks give you tools to find high quality data tailored to specific scientific investigations, locations, and time periods using APIs or **Application Programming Interfaces**. An API is a way for one piece of software to talk to another piece of software. In this case, the notebooks use APIs to talk to large databases maintained by government agencies or research institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of downloading a static file that might be years old, the notebooks guide you to \"speak\" directly to a live database through code. They allow you to ask a database for specific things, like air quality numbers for *your* town on *this* specific date. They also help filter the data so that the information you download is ready for classroom use and more likely to show interesting patterns that connect to your curriculum."

    "\n",
    "Each notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter environment like Google Colab, Binder, or JupyterHub. We assume you have some introductory knowledge of Jupyter notebooks and how to run them. If you do not, we recommend you check out the Show Your Work project first.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by opening the notebook file (.ipynb) in your Jupyter environment.\n",
    "2. Follow the text instructions provided in the notebook to understand what each section does.\n",
    "3. As you go, pay attention to the CHANGE HERE notes and change the settings to best suit your students' needs.\n",
    "4. Click on each code cell and run it to execute the code. Some cells may take a few moments to run, especially if they are fetching data from an API. If you run into an error, it is probably a dependency: make sure that you ran all the earlier code blocks that might be connected.\n",
    "5. After running and modifying the notebook, make sure to save your changes."

    "* **Skip the \"Search\":** We have done the work of finding the specific ways of searching for and filtering data that are likely to give you useful, \"generative\" patterns for teaching.\n",
    "* **Customize without coding from scratch:** Because the code is editable, you can simply change a location or a date to get a custom dataset without having to write a whole program yourself.\n",
    "* **Learn by doing:** By using these tools, you build your own comfort with data science and APIs, which helps you model these modern skills for your students."
